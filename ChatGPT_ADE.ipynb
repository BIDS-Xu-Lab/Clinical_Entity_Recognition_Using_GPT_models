In this case it should definitely be annotated twice. Additionally, we need to annotate the relief/improvement of the event if it is mentioned in the report. When no such information to decide whether it is a recurrence, the principle is that if there are multiple time stamps of the same event, we annotate it twice, if not, we can just keep one record.\n",
