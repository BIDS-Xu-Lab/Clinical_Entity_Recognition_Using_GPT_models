In the case where the patient reported a specific adverse event first, and then reported improvement / progress of the adverse event, we should annotate it as an improved symptom. However, we do NOT need to annotate the negation of a symptom which the patient never reported before.\n",
    "Events reported as history (events that did not happen to the reporting patient) should be annotated. Family history is important for risk prediction and may be included as a baseline information (e.g., for statistical analysis).\n",
    "Some VAERS reports have duplicate events reported. For example, the same events / text are repeated twice in the report. The case we are interested in, is the recurrence of some adverse event, i.e., it requires the adverse event appears, then disappear, and then come back. In this case it should definitely be annotated twice. Additionally, we need to annotate the relief/improvement of the event if it is mentioned in the report. When no such information to decide whether it is a recurrence, the principle is that if there are multiple time stamps of the same event, we annotate it twice, if not, we can just keep one record.\n",

    "### Annotation Guidelines\n",
    "Only annotate events that already occurred (i.e., occurred before the diagnosis of GBS).\n",
    "When annotating events related to Flu-GBS, do not include prepositions including modifiers of the event.\n",
    "Separate events in discontinuous segments.\n",
    "When annotating events, more generalized events should not be annotated.\n",
    "When annotating events related to symptom improvement / progress or negation events, the following guideline should be used. In the case where the patient reported a specific adverse event first, and then reported improvement / progress of the adverse event, we should annotate it as an improved symptom. However, we do NOT need to annotate the negation of a symptom which the patient never reported before.\n",
    "Events reported as history (events that did not happen to the reporting patient) should be annotated. Family history is important for risk prediction and may be included as a baseline information (e.g., for statistical analysis).\n",
    "Some VAERS reports have duplicate events reported. For example, the same events / text are repeated twice in the report. The case we are interested in, is the recurrence of some adverse event, i.e., it requires the adverse event appears, then disappear, and then come back. In this case it should definitely be annotated twice. Additionally, we need to annotate the relief/improvement of the event if it is mentioned in the report. When no such information to decide whether it is a recurrence, the principle is that if there are multiple time stamps of the same event, we annotate it twice, if not, we can just keep one record.\n",
