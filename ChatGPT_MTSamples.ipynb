    "Medical Problems are defined as: phrases that contain observations made by patients or clinicians about the patient’s body or mind that are thought to be abnormal or caused by a disease. They are loosely based on the UMLS semantic types of pathologic functions, disease or syndrome, mental or behavioral dysfunction, cellormolecular dysfunction, congenital abnormality, acquired abnormality,injury or poisoning, anatomic abnormality, neoplasticprocess, virus/bacterium, sign or symptom, but are not limited by UMLScoverage.\n",
    "Treatments are defined as: phrases that describe procedures, interventions, and substances given to a patient in an effort to resolve a medical problem. They are loosely based on the UMLS semantic types therapeutic or preventive procedure, medical device, steroid, pharmacologic substance, biomedical or dental material, antibiotic, clinical drug, and drug delivery device.  Other concepts that are treatments but that may not be found in UMLS are also included. Treatments that a patient had, will have, may have in the future, or are explicitly mentioned that the patient will not have are all marked as treatments.\n",
    "Tests are defined as: phrases that describe procedures, panels, and measures that are done to a patient or a body fluid or sample in order to discover, rule out, or find more information about a medical problem. They are loosely based on the UMLS semantic types laboratory procedure, diagnostic procedure, but also include instances not covered by UMLS.\n",
