    "### Entity Definitions\n",
    "Medical Problems are defined as: phrases that contain observations made by patients or clinicians about the patientâ€™s body or mind that are thought to be abnormal or caused by a disease. They are loosely based on the UMLS semantic types of pathologic functions, disease or syndrome, mental or behavioral dysfunction, cellormolecular dysfunction, congenital abnormality, acquired abnormality,injury or poisoning, anatomic abnormality, neoplasticprocess, virus/bacterium, sign or symptom, but are not limited by UMLScoverage.\n",
    "Treatments are defined as: phrases that describe procedures, interventions, and substances given to a patient in an effort to resolve a medical problem. They are loosely based on the UMLS semantic types therapeutic or preventive procedure, medical device, steroid, pharmacologic substance, biomedical or dental material, antibiotic, clinical drug, and drug delivery device.  Other concepts that are treatments but that may not be found in UMLS are also included. Treatments that a patient had, will have, may have in the future, or are explicitly mentioned that the patient will not have are all marked as treatments.\n",
    "Tests are defined as: phrases that describe procedures, panels, and measures that are done to a patient or a body fluid or sample in order to discover, rule out, or find more information about a medical problem. They are loosely based on the UMLS semantic types laboratory procedure, diagnostic procedure, but also include instances not covered by UMLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Annotation Guidelines:\n",
    "Only complete noun phrases (NPs) and adjective phrases (APs) should be marked. Terms that fit concept semantic rules, but that are only used as modifiers in a noun phrase should not be marked.\n",
    "Include all modifiers with concepts when they appear in the same phrase except for assertion modifiers.\n",
    "You can include up to one prepositional phrase (PP) following a markable concept if the PP does not contain a markable concept and either indicates an organ/body part or can be rearranged to eliminate the PP (we later call this the PP test).\n",
    "Include articles and possessives.\n",
    "Conjunctions and other syntax that denote lists should be included if they occur within the modifiers or are connected by a common set of modifiers. If the portions of the list are otherwise independent, they should not be included.  Similarly, when concepts are mentioned in more than one way in the same noun phrase (such as the definition of an acronym or where a generic and a brand name of a drug are used together), the concepts should be marked together.\n",
    "Concepts should be mentioned in relation to the patient or someone else in the note. Section headers that provide formatting, but that are not specific to a person are not marked.\n",
